# FT Utility Library

This repository hosts the `FT` utility library, a collection of essential C functions designed to perform common operations such as character output, string manipulation, and comparison. This header file (`ft.h`) serves as the interface for including and using these functions in C projects.

## Overview

The `FT` library includes the following functions:
- `ft_putchar`: Writes a single character to the standard output.
- `ft_swap`: Swaps the values of two integers.
- `ft_putstr`: Outputs a string to the standard output.
- `ft_strlen`: Returns the length of a string.
- `ft_strcmp`: Compares two strings lexicographically.
